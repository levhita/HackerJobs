; You will notice that some messages contain the string {0} (or {1}, {2} and so on).
; They act as placeholders for variable strings - be careful not to remove them.

; For example, in case of "Viewed {0} times", {0} will be replaced with the actual number of views when
; the message will be translated. this could result in "Viewed 5 times" (if the job ad has been viewed 5 times).

; Note: you can change the placeholders' order in a sentence in order to better suit your language.

; If you want to put the " (double quotes) character in your message, you must use &quot; instead.
