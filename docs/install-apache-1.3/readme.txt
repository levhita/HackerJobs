When running under Apache 1.3, you *must* use the .htaccess files found in this folder.

- copy .htaccess to your JobberBase root folder 
(an .htaccess file already exists in the root folder but you can safely overwrite it)
- copy .htaccess-admin to your JobberBase "admin" folder and rename it to .htaccess
